Read this short post for a few helpful hints. Save and like if you're digging the content!--1) When making turns, I suggest sinking your belly button down to allow for quicker turns and better terrain absorption. Think about the classic high school athletic and do that. --2) At times you want to be stacked, and at times, you want to have some upper and lower body separation. I like to use the stacked positions when my board is pointed down the hill. This means when I'm riding straight or taking off/ landing off of a feature. For this specific video, separation mainly comes from anticipating the turns. If you wanna turn left, rotate your shoulders left. --3) To enhance the turns, try a method called knee steering. This means turning your board with torsional twist of the board resulting in quick turns. I have a few different videos on this topic, dm for the links. --4) When riding these technical likes, look about 3/5 board lengths ahead, so you have time to process the information and prepare for the next obstacles --5) Ride at a pace that you can maintain your control. You may need to skip a feature a few times until you build the confidence, skills and awareness for the line. --6) Above all, have a progressive mindset, have fun, and stay safe, my doods!--#Snowboarding #snowboardtricks #snowboardaddiction #snowbarders #snowboardingisfun #skiresorts",

I used to ride logs all the time with my bother @richard_Bennett87 all the time, and this brings back so many memories. Building and riding you're own creation is one of the best feelings ever. --I suggest dialing in your 5050 on kink rails before trying this on a log. --1) The more important part about cleaning the whole up/flat/down log starts with your setup. When you're riding into the log, keep your spine upright and mass centered over your board. Your board should be pointed directly at the beginning of the log to keep it lined up through the feature.--2) Absorb the transition from the snow to the up log with your knees. If you absorb with your hips, it will cause your center of mass to lean off the log. You must keep your center of mass directly over the log. This will help you ride the whole thing, trust me. --3) Once you made it to the flat log, lock your eyes at the end of the rail and absorb the kinds as you ride over them. Also, keep your lead shoulder pointed at the end of the log as well. If your shoulder is open, it can cause your board to rotate and catch an edge. Keep everything stacked. --4) Once you're about to hit the down log, it gets a little technical. The goal is to keep your board in contact with the log but prepare for the transition to snow. I like to extend my knees, allowing my board to touch the down log but my shoulders are matching the angle of the snow. --Ride away and keep killing it!--#Snowboarding #logs #tricks #fun #love ",

Let's break this down, my doods!--The first thing you gotta do is find a log that's within your ability level. Def practice your boardslide on boxes and rails before trying this on a log. Make sure your good at down rails while being gentle with the downhill edge. I like doing a 5050 to a boardslide on the down because it's easier to set up.--1) Ride into the feature setup straight and pointing your lead should, hip and board towards the kink. Keep your weight centered and eyes focused on the kink. --2) Do a 5050 on the first part of the log with the stacked body positions. The goal is to ride through the kink, so make sure you're body positions allow this trick to happen. If you're falling off the rail, it's hard to boardslide the whole thing.--3) As you get to the kink of the rail, extend your legs a bit. You're looking to create a small bit of separation from you and the log. This will help you get into the boardslide with minimal resistance. --4) As you're in the air, rotate your hips and board to 90 degrees while keeping your lead shoulder pointed at the end of the log. You will be in a countered position, and that will help you come back out your normal direction. --5) As your board rotates 90 degrees, keep about 80-90 percent of your weight over your heels. I don't want you to over exaggerate this position cause you'll slip out. You need to keep your toes up slightly, so you don't catch your edge on the log. --6) Keep your toes press up against the top of your boot and ride through the end of the rail. I like to favor my back foot because I have more control and balance. --7) After riding off the rail, point your board down the hill and ride away like a boss!--#snowboarding #boardslide #logging #snowboardAddiciton #snowbarders #snowbardtricks #skiresorts #colorado #snow #spring #springtime #snowboardtrips #snowboardingisfun #MissingSnowboarding #StayingPositive #tommieb1 #tommiebennett #vlog #Gaming ",

Also, I'm going live tomorrow night on my youtube channel at 7 pm Mst. If you wanna join and hang out, dm for the link. --Practice your switch riding a bunch and build your confidence in your landing. The more you ride switch, the more you will be able to trust your switch landing and body positions. --1) On the run in, make a few turns to manage your speed and get yourself aligned with the rail. Depending on the feature, you may have to hit it from the side vs. straight on. --2) As you ride up the jump, make a small heelside turn to get ready to pop while winding up your shoulders. --3) Extend your knees and throw your shoulders in the frontside direction. Driving your back hip for the full 180 and pointing it at the end of the rail really helps me land in a strong switch position. Also, if your lead shoulder lags too far behind, it can cause you to land in a backseat position. If you land in the backseat, you increase your chances of getting wrecked.... trust me; I've done it way too many times. haha.--4) Make sure your board has rotated a full 180 before making contact with the rail. As your board hits the rail, absorb the impact. --5) Remain in a strong position for the duration of the rail. For me, this was like 1 millionth of a second lol. --6) Land in a strong position with your knees, hips, and shoulders stacked over the board. This position will increase your chances of landing the trick because you can absorb the impact in a balanced position. --Land and ride away like a boss!--#snowboarding #180 #frontside180 #snowboardAddiciton #snowbarders #snowbardtricks #skiresorts #colorado #snow #spring #springtime #snowboardtrips #snowboardingisfun #MissingSnowboarding #StayingPositive #tommieb1 #tommiebennett #vlog #Gaming ",

Save this post and let me know what you think below. --Here's a side approach nose slide/tap. The snow was melting out too much, and we couldn't hit it. I didn't wanna waste an opportunity to have some fun, so I did this. lol--Work on your ollie and knee retraction if you're finding this difficult. --1) Find a feature that's within your comfort zone and perform the biggest ollie you can just to the side of the feature. This will give you an indication if you're able to get your board and body high enough to tap the feature. --2) Ride towards the feature you wanna bonk with a 15 degree trajectory. This trajectory will give you enough angle to get close to the feature without going over it. --3) You need to create as much power as possible. Slightly rock forward and then rapidly rock backward. In addition, retract your lead knee to build as much pressure on the board as possible. Next, extend your back foot and explode upwards.--4) As you're starting to catch air, rotate your lead hip 90 degrees towards the feature. The goal is to get your nose above the feature and then tap down. Don't forget to retract your back leg so its just as high as the lead leg.  Keep your lead shoulder pointed straight down the hill. You will end up in a counter rotation position in the air. --5) At this point, your nose should be over the feature and then extend your lead knee down and tap the feature. Don't be overly aggressive with the bonk because you don't wanna bounce off and lose your balance. --6) Tap the feature and then prepare for the landing. Rotate your lower body, so its pointed down the fall line. Keep your weight centered and absorb the impact.

Find the right setup that fits your skills and ability level. --1) Set your board up directly in front of the opening. --2) I placed my lead foot between the biding and the back foot on the tail. This foot placement helped me steer the board into the corrugated pipe without catching my shin. --3) As you riding into the feature, keep your balance as centered as possible, and minimize your drifting. This is so hard at times, lol. --4) As the nose of your board enters the tube, take your lead foot, and place it on top of the tube. I suggest placing about 60 percent of your weight on the tube because if you have too much weight on your back foot, you will slip out and get wrecked, trust me....lol.--5) As your lead foot is on top, slide the board into the pipe while controlling its speed with your back foot. --6) Run on the pipe while keeping your eye at the end of the tube and your balance steady. --7) As you're running on the tube, listen to the board clanking around on the inside. By listening to the board, you will determine its location and speed. Kinda interesting tho, I've never used sound to land a trick. --8) Try to time the run and to board perfectly, so you meet the end of the pipe at the time. This step might take a few tries to dial. --9) Look for the board to exit the pipe and try to land on the board in a balanced position.

Do you struggle with fear when you snowboard? DM for a video I made on this exact subject. Like this post and save it for next season.--The main goal was to use the up log as a setup for the 180, but the 180 has to be fast, so you can land back on the log without gapping over the whole thing. --1) Line straight into the feature and wind up your lead shoulder by closing it about 30 degrees. --2)Ride up the feature with your center of mass directly overtop of the feature. If you're leaning over your toes or heels, you will drift off the log. --3) It's extremely important that you time the rotation after you leave the log. If you rotate too early, you may catch the log with your edge or change your trajectory and send yourself off the side. --4) Throw your lead shoulder, and then ollie, but don't engage your core until you're in the air. Your core is used to connect the upper and lower body together. If your core is disengaged when you throw the trick, it won't translate to the board rotating until you max out your body's range of motion. This timing and sequence of moves can be very tricky. --5) Spin your shoulders, hips, and board a full 180 degrees. If you underrotate this part, it can lead to you catching an edge and crashing. You need to commit to the 180 and land back on the log in a switch 5050. --6) As your board touches the log, absorb the impact with your knees, and keep your spine upright. Most people absorb the impact primarily through their hips, and that will cause your center of mass to lean off the rail. As you land, you need to stay in a strong and balanced position directly on top of the rail. Practice your 180's and switch riding to build your confidence for the landings. --7) Ride the log switch with your eyes, lead shoulder and board pointed at the end of the rail. --8) Ride off the log and extend your back leg to keep in contact with the log.

If you're digging the content, save your favorite posts you have them for next year. --We have an up/flat/down log in the video, but you can use this breakdown for gapping to the other features or disaster rails. --1) As I ride into the feature, I know that I have to keep my line perfect so I can land on the down. It all starts with the run in. I set myself up straight into the feature about 3 board lengths before the beginning of the rail. --2) About 1 board length before the log, I bend my knees and get ready to ollie off up part.  As you hit the transition between the snow and the up log, don't flex or extend. If you add any other movements at the transition, it can throw off your ollie sequence. --3) Ride up the log and time your ollie, so the tail leaves as late as possible. When you time the ollie, you will get more amplitude, and you will cover more distance. You will need to adjust your speed, timing, or pop for different features. --4) After you ollie, bring your knees up towards your collarbone. Imagine you're an airplane, and you gotta fly in the air with your wheels retracted into the bottom of the plane. Once the plane is ready to land, it will put down the land gears, right? Notice in this video that I keep my knees up until I'm ready to make contact with the log. Also, I keep my shoulders, hips board all pointed where I wanna land. --5) For this specific log, the down log is relatively steep, but then it transitions really fast to flat. I gotta anticipate both landings. With my lower body, I'm handling the first landing on the log by extending my lead knee, so my board matches the angle. My shoulders are matching the terrain of the snow and handle the second part of the landing. If my shoulders are too far forward, my center of mass will be far forward and cause me to flip over my know. Techy, right? --6) Ride away like a boss!

Hop on the tube from with your font side facing it. keep your body stacked directly over the feature and make small adjustments with your ankles.--2) Once you find your balance and you're ready for the first 180, begin by winding up your shoulders and bend your knees. As you're winding up and bending your knees, control your movements, so you don't lose your balance. --3) When you pop, I highly recommend that you extend both feet at the same time, straight up and down. This will help prevent you from drifting or accidentally hopping off the rail. --4) Initiate the spin with your lead shoulder and pop. Once you're in the air, retract your knees, engage your core, rotate your board a full 180 degrees. I tend to counter rotate my shoulder ride before I land to slow down the rotation. --5) Once you complete the 180, make contact with the feature, absorb the impact. As you impact, you immediately have to regain your balance. The more you keep your spine relatively verticle, the easier it will be to balance. if you're leaning over with your shoulders and hips, you will naturally wanna fall off. --6) Perform this same sequence switch.

If this is a trick you wanna learn next year, def SAVE this post my doods!--This trick will be a bit easier if you already have a switch front board, a front 270, and understand how counter rotation works. --1) Find a rail that is within your comfort zone. Dial in the speed and the pop before trying this trick. --2) Ride into the rail with a slight \"S\" turn. Ride up the jump on your heelside edge. You can rotate on the jump about 10-15 degrees, but don't overdo it. --3) Wind up and throw your shoulders in the frontside direction and immediately stop at 180 degrees. It's essential that you stop the shoulders at 180 because you need your lower body to do a 270 and then came back and land a 180. If your shoulders do a 270 or 360, its extremely hard to land back switch. Does that make sense?--4) Like I said above, keep your lower body rotating to the 270 point. This body position should be familiar if you have a switch front board. This rail begins so small; I was only able to tap the front board. I made sure I hit the rail and was 90 degrees across the rail. --5) After doing the 270, you're going to need to stop the rotation and get your lower body to land back switch. You can achieve this by adding counter rotation after the tap. Rewatch the video and notice that I'm forcing my switch nose to point down the hill. My shoulders are a bit twisted, but I still get the trick. --6) Being super comfortable and confident in your switch riding really helps in situations like this. If you're able to trust your switch landing, you're more likely to put yourself in a body position that makes landing easier.

I learned this at the beginning of the season, but I totally forgot about it till recently. Kinda funny how #snowboard tricks come and go sometimes. --I suggest being super comfortable popping, catching air, grabbing seatbelt, and tuck knee. The best part of this trick is you can learn all the elements individually and then put them together. --1) Find a log, jump, pipe, side hit, or rail that gives you enough hangtime to get this trick done. --2) For this example of the log, I slightly retracted my lead knee and did an ollie. The ollie will give me just a bit more hand time, and I needed every bit I could get.--3) As I got in the air, I immediately retract my lead knee across my body and bring the other knee up to get the grab. Right before I get the grab, I'm starting to shift my hips forward and my spine back. You wanna do this to get the grab, get the tweak but also stay centered, so you don't crash. Rewatch this video a few times if needed. --4) After you grab, maximize the tweak of the tuck knee. I like to extend and point my lead knee towards the ground. This will make the tail of your board come closer to your head. --5) As you're tweaking the grab, take your lead hand... reach back and grab your tail. It's hard to keep your eyes looking down towards the landing because of your lead hand crosses your face. For a split second look way and then look back.--6) Hold this grab as long as you can. I didn't have much time to hold the grab, and I needed to prep for this gnarly impact that about to happen. --7) As you land, make your weight is distributed between both feet and your shoulders are stacked over the board. --Remember, save this post and tag a friend!--#Snowboarding #killingit #killinIt #yewww #homepro #gopro #snowboardtricks #snowboardgrabs #snowboarders #stancesocks #burton #burtonboots #tricks #tricksarefun",

Be creative, and let's keep moving during these crazy times. --Here's a backside 270 pullback to cab 1. Let's break this down!--1a) For the 270... Wind up the lead shoulder while bending your knees. Next, pop with both knees and throw the shoulders only 180 degrees. Stop your shoulders from rotating at 180, but keep your lower body going to the 270. When you stop your shoulders, you will be in a lower and upper body countered position. This Countered position will help you do the pullback. Rewatch the video, specifically watching the shoulders to understand this better.--1b) Also, When you land on one foot, it makes it easier to do the pullback. As you're doing the 270 with your lower body, shift your weight so only one foot lands on the feature. Also, you'll notice that I extend my lead foot and flex my back foot right before I land.--2) As you're in the countered position, extend your back foot and rotate, so you land switch on the feature. You may need to use some counter rotation of the shoulders again to get the rotation. --3) After landing switch, you'll be landing in another countered position. This will help you add a 180 into the mix because your shoulders are in a ready position. You don't have to do this sequence as fast as I did but that def would be the goal.--A few additional Pointers--keep your chest tall to help maintain balance and have lots of movement options. If you're to flexed at the hips, you may shift forward and struggle to stay on the feature. --As you land, absorb the impact as if your landing on eggshells. This will help you control your landing, stay balanced, and set you up for popping the next trick. --#Snowboarding #challange #gopro8 #gopromax #goprohomepro #snowboarder #snowboard",

Thanks to my new Snowboard Sponsor @snowboard_addiction for the sick board and balance bar!--Lets breakdown the at home 3 and then how to take that to snow. --Frontside 360 at Home:--1) I suggest placing a shoelace or a piece of tape on the ground and practicing the steps below. Once you're feeling super confident, find a safe object to land on, such as a couch cushion or a balance bar. --2) Line up your body with your backside facing the rail about 5-10 inches way. You wanna line up on your heel edge because this will translate to snow. --3) Flex down with your knees and close your lead shoulder. This position will generate the rotational momentum as well as the pop needed to get in the air. --4) After sinking down, lean towards the rail about 10 degrees and then rapidly throw your shoulder in the frontside direction while extending both your knees. This combination of moments will get you the air, rotation, and trajectory onto the feature. --5) Once you're in the air, engage your core aggesvily, and look at where you need to land. When you spot with only your eyes, it will help you spot the landing but more importantly, you'll land in a stacked and balanced position--6) You won't have a lot of time to prepare for the landing, so make sure you're ready for the impact. Again, practice on a shoelace before moving on to a feature. --7) land... lol--Taking it to snow. --When you take this 3 to snow, the biggest difference will be speed, airtime, and how slick the feature will be.

When I was a kid, my local resort had tons of these things in their main terrain park. Def super sick. Save this post and tag a friend! Also, I got some sick new live at home snowboard training coming out next week. Keep an eye on my post for more info coming in the next day or so.--If you find one of these in the woods, def keep it low key and don't trash them. Someone put tons of work into, so don't wreck it. Thanks, doods--You can use these break down for the same style metal rail found on most resorts. Let's break it down. --1) Ride into the feature with a decent amount of speed and line yourself up directly in front of the log. This will keep the 5050 super simple. If you're doing 100 little turns before the rail, chances are you will mess it up. keep it simple. --2) As you ride up the ramp, I like to look at the first kink with my eyes. I like looking here because it will help my body ride to that spot.  Look down, go down. --3) As you're on the feature, keep your center of mass stacked directly over top of the rail. If you are inclined 20 degrees towards your heelside edge, your naturally going to fall off. Stay stacked my doods.--4) As you approach the kink, absorb it with your knees and stay connected to the log. At this time, I move my eyes and attention to the end of the rail. I want all my focus and momentum to go towards the end of the rail. --5) After hitting the kink, keep your knees bent and make micro adjustments with your ankles to stay on the rail. Notice that my shoulders are parallel to the angle of the log. This will have you be in a strong and stacked position. Keep that in mind when you're hitting down rails in general--6) I like to either pop or ollie off the end to build my confidence for other tricks like a 180 out. This is a good test to see how much air you have. --Land and ride away like a boss. --#snowboarding #Snowboard5050 #logs #snowboardlogs #logging #snowboardmag #snowboarders #snowboardforlife #yewww #killinit #colorado #telossnowboards #Snowboardaddiction",

You must have Venmo or PayPal to accept the cash. --Switchback lips are way less intimidating and easier to do on smaller features. Find a feature that's within your comfort zone before attempting this trick--1) Ride into the rail with your backside facing the feature. I like talking about a 15 degree trajectory into the rail because this gives me enough angle into the rail without jumping over the entire thing. --2) It can be difficult to pop off your heelside edge. I like to overcompensate by using my knees more. Ride up the jump and pop as late as you can. This will help with the next step. --3) The biggest thing about a back lip is committing to the trick while being patient. You must pop, let your tail rise above the rail, and then shift into a frontside boardslide. A lot of times, with this trick, people become impatient and try to shift their board to soon. This will cause you to clip the rail. It's not sick, trust me!--4) Once your tail has cleared the rail, drive your back heel down the rail. I like to land on the inside of your lead binding because that helps prevent your board from sogging. As you're rotating your board, keep your lead shoulder pointed at the end of the rail or slightly open. This will help you stay switch vs. rotating back to your normal direction. --5) Stay on the rail as long as you need to ride through the end. --6) Ride at the end of the rail, pop off your lead foot a little and realign your lower body with your upper.

Thanks, @johnathanbuckhouse for the clips dood!--I have some stickers and the hoodie in the video for sale. Dm, if you want some links.--1) This frontside indy foot plant takes lots of coordination, control, and precise timing. I recommend that you have frontside airs (180's) on Quarter pipes, indy grabs, and have some crazy good one foot skills. --2) Ride into the quarter pipe with enough speed that will get you to the top without sending you over. --3) Right before the transition, wind up your lead shoulder and flex your knees. --4) Right before the lip, pop and throw your shoulders about 130 degrees. You wanna have upper and lower body separation when you land in the fast plan. The shoulders will help you finish the rotation at the end of the trick. --5) As you're in the air, aggressively retract your lead knee to your chest while taking your back foot and placing it on top of the QP. About the same time your back foot hits the ground, you should be grabbing indy. --6) Absorb the impact of the landing with your back foot. When you absorb the impact, this also sets you up to pop back into the landing. Rewatch the video to see how that works. --7) Remember, step 4. As you have upper and lower body separate, your lead shoulder is leading the rotation and making it easy to land back in your normal direction. Also, notice how my center of mass/ shoulders is still hanging to the inside of the QP? This is important to get your body to land back inside of the QP. --8) Pop off your back foot and quickly place your foot back on your board while pushing against the inside of the back binding. The more pressure place sideways on the back binding, the more control and balance you will have. --9) Absorb the impact with both your knees and ride away--#snowboarding #snowboard #quarterpipe #Telossnowboards #ride #Snowboardtricks #snowboardmag #snowboarders #snowboardforlife #yewww #killinit #colorado",

Yewww!--Everything about doing a 540 is on the next level, so read all the steps below. Remember, a backside spin is when the backside of your body is facing the designated downhill for the first 90 degrees. It's easy to confuse frontside and backside, so I hope this helps--1) I suggest dialing in the back 360 like a boss before attempting this. You can also work up to 450 and then 540. --2) You need to exaggerate your pop and throw. Wipe up your lead shoulder and bend down to maximize your pop and throw. --3) I like to open my shoulder until I create a large amount of functional tension and then releasing that tension by throwing my shoulders in the opposite direction. It's like kicking a ball into the wall and watching it bounce back. Spend a few mins finding the optimal throw--4) As you throw your shoulders, keep your shoulders flat like a table. If you angle or dip your shoulders, you will have a hard time staying balanced, thus making the landing even harder. Also, extend both of your feet at the same time, so you travel verticle. It's easy to jump off one foot, and that can cause you to be outta balance. --5) Let your eyes lead the rotation and engage the crap outta your core. You want to stay relatively connected as possible. Retract your knees to increase the time in the air.--6)  The most common problems you will face will be dipping your head towards the ground or popping off one foot forcing you to be outta balance. Also, if you look down at your feet, you will hinder your rotation. --**If you keep your body stacked and balanced, throwing this trick hard won't be super challenging to stay on your feet. --7) Be ready for the landing and absorb the impact.

(This was filmed before Colorado got locked down) Stay safe my doods, and scope out my stories for fun at home snowboard challenges. --This is a frontside 360 because as you initiate the trick, the front side of your body is facing the landing for the first 90 degrees. Backside would be the opposite. Frontside/backside can get super confusing, so I hope this helps. --1) Before spinning this gap, I did straight air the jump to get a feel for the speed and the pop. Before trying 360's on real jumps, make sure you have them on lock my doods!--2) As I was riding up the jump, I knew I need to keep my speed up, so I was very patient on the takeoff. It's really easy on frontside spins to skid your takeoff to much. If you scrub to much speed, you will knuckle, and that's not fun. --3) Get low by flexing your knees and time the extension as the front of your board is across the lip. Also, close your shoulders 45 degrees and throw the spin with the same timing as your pop. This will help maximize your overall speed and allow your trajectory to clear the gap with the spin.--** if you're trying 360's at home, work on your pop and throw with the same timing and maximize your pop/ rotation. --4) Next, look over your lead shoulder and engage your core like someone is about to punch you in the stomach. When you engage your core, it will help connect the upper body and lower body. I slightly rotated off axis  but keep my body connected and in control--5) Spot your landing and prepare for the impact. I like landing with my feet at the same time to help protect my knees and absorb the impact. I like shifting my center of mass to the center of the board ASAP. --6) I did over juice this one a bit but still handled the crazy impact. I tried really hard to control my lead shoulder from adding any unwanted rotation. If your lead shoulder keeps rotating, it will most likely cause you to spin out, and that's not ideal. --#Yewww--#snowboarding #snowboard #frontside3 #snowboardtricks #staysafe #oldclips #Telossnowboards",

Make sure you have enough space and nothing dangerous around you. --1) The key is to understand how to generate a significant amount of rotational momentum and enough air to get this trick around. --2) Take your lead shoulders and open it up towards your heelside edge about 45-90 degrees while flexing down with your knees. You have to use this windup and throw it like a baseball swing. You want to wind up and then immediately throw the shoulders in the opposition. The same goes for your knees. Ideally, you don't pause between the change of directions. --3)Throw your shoulders while extending your knees. Once you have completed this step, continue driving your shoulders in the backside direction. I like to look over my lead shoulder and spot the landing as possible. This will help the rotation and keep your chest tall at the landing.--4) The sooner you spot the landing, the sooner you know how much more you have to rotation.

If you got any creative or clever ways to snowboards, show them off by tagging me on your Instagram story, and I'll share it on mine. --For some reason, I like doing nose blocks more than tail blocks, and a seatbelt grab comes naturally to me. A seatbelt grab is when you take your lead hand and reach across your body then grab the tail. Have you tried this before? Let me know below. --If you're struggling with a block in general, I suggest starting with a nose/tail press. Next, rock into that press by creating a bit of momentum with your hips and legs. Continue to exaggerate that momentum and get the tip of your board progressively higher and higher. After a while, attempt to grab the tip of your board briefly. After touching the grab, try to hold the grab for a 1 count, and there you go. Also, go back a few days in my feed, I breakdown how to do the block in depth. --1) One you got Blocks down like a boss, try mixing up the grabs. It's important to take your knee and drive it across your body. This will allow the tail of your snowboard to get really close to your shoulder/head and make that grab a bit easier. --2) Take your lead hand and reach across your body and then down to grab the tail. You wanna get the grab before the nose of your board hits the ground. If you grab too late, the board will get ripped outta your hand. --At first, it's totally cool to tap the board then grab it. If the grab is not close enough, exaggerate bending your knee across your body. --3) Hold the grab and leg the board flex a bit. Keep your center of mass over your tail and use the bounce of the board to pop out. --4) After popping outta the trick, return back to a strong and stacked stance.

If you let your shoulders ride through and over the lip, the rest of your body will follow. Let's break it down...--1) Ride into the QP with enough speed to ride up and out. Go as fast as you're comfortable. --2) In the flat, before the transition begins sinking down. Also, keep your shoulders, hips, and board all pointed in the same direction. If any of your body parts are rotated, it can cause unwanted spins. --3) As you're riding up the quarter pipe, lean back to keep your shoulders parallel with the transition and progressivly extend your knees. You wanna pop slightly up and back into transition. You gotta find the balance of these two to ensure you're catching air and landing back down the QP--4) Once you're in the air, keep your body stacked. Retract your back knee a bit more than the lead knee. Next, grab indy by grabbing the board with your backhand around the knee and between the bindings.--5) Hold the grab and extend your lead knee to add a bit of creatively to the air. --6) Let go of the grab as your coming back down to earth. Shift your weight back a bit to land on both feet at the same time. As you're riding down the QP, manage your pressure, so you stay on your feet.

I suggest practicing the nose and tail block independently and then putting them together. In most cases, either the nose or tail block will feel easier. You can --1) I like to start this trick by getting low and jumping with both knees. After jumping, shift your center of mass towards the end of the board that you will balance on. --2) As you're are jumping and shifting your weight, retract one knee across your body and slightly sweep the other foot under your center of mass. Extend the other. By making this move, it will make the tip of your board closer to your hand, and the other end makes contact with the ground. --3) You want to secure the grab before balancing all your weight on the other end of the board. As your board makes contact with the ground, absorb the impact slightly by flexing into the board. --4) After flexing your board and getting the grab, use the natural bounce, and pop out to land on both feet.--5) After you have the nose/ tail blocks, try linking them together. As you extend your back foot, extend it towards the other end of the board slightly. This will get your center of mass over the other end of the board. --6) You need to retract and extend the opposite knees rapidly. This needs to be extremely fast because you gotta land back into the new block. Keep your chest tall and centered.

I'm stoked to partner with these guys and bring you guys more breakdown, tips and of course tricks. Def give these guys a follow so you can see more #Snowboarding breakdowns. Sorry about missing the run in!--You gotta find a tree or feature that makes this trick easier. You're looking for a jump that has enough distance before/after the feature to get all the rotations around. Most of this trick is in the shoulders, but let's break it down. --1) Ride into the feature like you're doing a frontside 180. Make sure your lead shoulder is close in preparation for throwing the trick and get ready to pop. --2) As you ride into and off the jump, throw your lead shoulder for the 180. As you throw the shoulders, slightly counter your lower body. As your lower body is countered, tap the tree. You may need to extend your back leg to get the tap. Notice that I'm not slamming into the tree and bouncing off. It's def possible to do that, but you may wreck your board, and the rotation out will be less controlled. --3) Remember how you tossed that lead shoulder for the 180? You're going to need that rotational momentum now... After tapping the tree, drive your back shoulder towards the landing and rotate your lower body in the frontside direction.--4) As you're rotating in the air, keep your eyes spotting the landing about 8 feet in front of you. Continue driving your board to complete the rotation and land with both feet at the same time. --5) You may land slightly countered, but the main goal is to get your board down the fall line and your center of mass stacked over the center of the board. If your weight is off, you may fall back or catch an edge. --Practice this trick at your house or on a small feature first.

Combining these two things was def pushing my ability for sure. --This trick is super challenging because you don't get to use two feet for popping, and you don't get much of a wind up for the flip. @johnathan and I spent about 2.5 hours building this thing, but you can find this butter box in some terrain parks. It def helps to have a feature that has a decent drop off. --1) Ride into the feature with speed that you can control and process but isn't so slow.--2) Use the first jump as a way to set up your tail press. As you take off the jump, shift your legs in front of you, and shift your hip back. As you make contact with the snow, keep the nose of your board in the air. I do this by exaggerating the tail press while absorbing the impact and retracting my front knee. This may be the hardest part of the trick. --3) Hold the tail press and keep your eyes at the end of the feature. Also, keep your lead shoulder pointed at the end of the box, so you don't drift on the butter body. --4) As you get close to the end of the box, shift your weight further back over your tail, so your nose doesn't hit the lip. While you're shifting back, drop your back shoulder and extend your back leg to initiate the flip. --5a) I'll be honest, I was flipping and doing what felt natural and easiest to land. I want to clean the flip a bit and add a grab next time I hit this thing again. -5b) With a flip out of a tail press, it's extremely important to commit to the rotation and keep it going. You will feel like you won't get the flip around, but it's better to get close to landing on your feet vs. panicking and landing on your head. --6) Spot the landing and get your weight in a position that allows you to handle the landing.

This heelside turn will help create a little momentum as well as get you onto the feature. --2) As you're in the air, rotate your board and land on your back foot. To land on your back foot, shift your legs underneath your center of mass and get your belly button to land directly over the rail. --3) Once your board makes contact with the rail, excessively flex your back leg for style points, but more importantly, this position will help you pop off the rail. you can practice this position off the rail to get more comfortable. --4) As you're on the rail, allow your lead shoulder to rotate towards the end of the rail while your lower body stays at 90 degrees on the rail. You must continue rotating your shoulders to help get the 270 around. --5) As you get to the end of the rail, retract your lead knee to build pressure on the tail of your board. You wanna build pressure because it will increase the air allowing you to have more time to rotate the 270. --6) Aggressively extend your back foot while looking over your lead shoulder and utilize that momentum from the previous steps to get the 270 out. --7) As you're doing the 270 out, you may need to spin your lower body faster to ensure the nose of your board is pointed downhill. --8) As you make contact with the ground, center your weight and land like a boss. --#snowboarding",

I like landing on the feature just inside my front binding or directly on top. I prefer this because its easier to balance, but more importantly, it allows me to \"nollie\" outta the feature. If you're in the dead center, it can be hard to add tricks like FS boardslide pretzel.--4) As you land on the rail, keep your center of mass directly over the feature. If you're too far forwards or backwards, you may slip off or slip out. --5) keep your core super tight and use your arms and legs/ankles to hold that balanced position. I challenge you to hold this for 1min!--6) As you wanna exit this trick, aggressively extend your lead foot while leaning towards the direction you wanna go out. Hopping forwards is going to be more challenging than hopping back. ---#snowboarding #snowboarders #snowboardtricks #cvlogs #snowboardvlogs #snowboardhowto #learnsnowboardtricks #snowboardingisfun #vanssnowboard #snowboardaddiction #snowobardaddictionboard #snowboardinspirtation #yewww #killingit #rideordie",

I will be dropping an in depth video on tricks you need to learn at your house right away! Keep an eye out for that one!--You can use your snowboard or a snowboard Addiction board while we're all dealing with this mess. They both work amazingly well. Next, you can learn simple tricks like nose/tail presses or 180's. If you're looking for a challenge, try adding tricks together or use a foam roller, couch cushion, or a spare tire. Start small and work your way up.--1) I decided to challenge myself by using a cushion because the landing is unstable, and this requires more precise movement and better balance. --2) Line up your belly button with the center of the cushion. Next, jump onto the cushion while shifting your legs forward. Rewatch the video as needed to see how the legs move, and the center of mass does not. This movement will help you get into the rail press really fast while keeping your center of mass in the center of the feature. --3) As you land, the cushion will compact and then shift your weight in a weird direction. The goal is to absorb the impact and maintain balance. To maintain balance, you may have to move your ankle, hips, shoulders, or arms. Hold this position as long as you can/ want.--4) After holding the tail press, shift your weight over your heels and then extend your back foot to pop out. Once you pop out, shift your legs back to being centered and absorb the impact. --I want to see you guys get super creative while you may have some extra free time.

I feel that I can lock onto the rail easier and get set up for the three out better. Do the f/s 5050 and absorb the landing. --2) After getting locked onto the rail, stay low because your next movement will be the pop and rotation. --3) As you're getting close to the end of the rail, begin driving your lead shoulder in the frontside direction. While you're rotating your shoulders, let the nose of your board ride off the feature while retracting your lead knee. The retraction of the lead knee will build up pressure on your board like you're doing a crazy ollie. This specific rail doesn't have a huge drop off, so you need to create the air yourself. --4) Next, explode off the rail and then continue the frontside rotation. The biggest struggle with doing this trick is not looking over your lead shoulder. The more you look over your shoulder, the quicker the rotation will be. --5) As you get to the 270 marks, you may need to accelerate the lower body to get your board around. You can accelerate the rotation of the board by rotating your hips or using a scissor movement with your legs. The scissor movement means pushing your back foot 45-90 degrees and pulling your lead foot 45-90 degrees. Rewatch the video and study this part as needed. It's ok if you lead your shoulders slightly behind.--6) As your board is now pointed down the hill, absorb the impact. Your upper body will want to catch up to the upper body, but control that so you don't over rotate once you've hit the ground. You'll notice I jam my toeside edge in to prevent that unwanted rotation. --Stay safe my doods!--#snowboarding #snowboard #snowboardlife #snowboard4life #snowboardtricks #railtricks #snowboardrailtricks #snowboardparks #snowboardingisfun #telossnowboards #yewww #killingit!",

        "description": "When you build a jump, you have to backflip it, right? Here's some more clips from the jump build. Next on the list is hitting a rail and then finding some other creative ways to snowboard without the resorts. Comment below and let me know if you got any ideas, and don't forget to save this post so you can study it later. Thanks my doods!--1) Hit the jump a few times so you know the speed and how it feels. This jump didn't need much speed and had a smooth lip allowing me to mostly dictate the amount of the pop.--2) The two most important parts about the backflip are body positions and commitment. The commitment starts with the run in and continues until the trick is landed.  I like using strong body positions to help keep me committed. I know if I'm lined upright, and in a strong stance, it's easier for me to commit.--3) As you're riding in, keep your shoulders, hips, and board stacked while your center of mass is in the center of the board. This body position is strong, and again will help you commit. --4) As you're riding into the jump, bend your knees so you can pop like a boss. Keep your chest relatively verticle and your eyes looking at the lip.--5) As you go up the face of the jump, extend your knees. You wanna pop and then throw the flip. This tactic will help you get enough power to flip and prevent you from hitting your head on the jump. Focus on being patient and then flipping. A lot of snowboarders focus on the flip and get wrecked, don't let that be you. --6) As you leave the lip of the jump, drive your head back to initiate the flip. I like to retract my knees almost immediately so I can grab my snowboard. --7) As you're in the air, continue the rotation by looking for the landing. Now, the bigger the jump, the less hard you have to drive your head. --8) Spot the landing and then either hold the grab or open up to slow down.  Next, pull your legs down and touch the snow. Absorb the impact as much as possible. --#snowboardtricks #snowboarding #snowboard #telossnowboards #snowboardingisfun #colorado #tricks #tricksarefun #NoResortRiding #Buildingajump #killingit #Snowboardingstill #nostopping",

Thanks, @maxduffy134, for the hype and filming! Give this dood a follow! Lastly, I'm encouraging everyone to be smart about where they ride and take every precaution to be safe. --1) I have posted this flip before, but today I'll be more focused on how to slow the rotation down when you're hitting jumps or larger features. This flip isn't overly big, but bigger than I have posted in the past. --2) As you approach the transition of the jump, keep your lead shoulder, board, and hips pointed at the jump. Also, bend your knee and be prepared to boost!--3) As you're getting closer to the lip of the jump, shift your weight back and then rapidly forward over your nose. You must focus on popping then rotating. Most snowboarders who struggle with this only focus on the rotation, not the pop, then rotate. --4) I like to throw the trick and leave the jump about 6 inches to 1 foot before the lip. If you wait too long, you wont have enough pop. If you go to early, you minimize the air, and you may hit your head on the jump. --5) I like to project my body up in the air and delay the actual flip. I delay the flip by not tucking my shoulder under my body and staring at the landing with my eyes.  I'm looking at the landing, determining how I can wait before driving the flip. I didn't have time to hold this flip, but the concept can be used on large jumps.--6) Drive your lead shoulder down past your nose and keep driving until you spot the landing. As you spot the landing, determine how much more you need to drive/rotate. The goal is to landing in a stacked position and eyes looking over your nose. If you reach for the ground, you go down. --7) Ride Away and keep killing it!--#snowboardtricks #snowboarding #snowboard #telossnowboards #snowboardingisfun #colorado #tricks #tricksarefun #NoResortRiding #Buildingajump #killingit #Snowboardingstill #nostopping",

Save this post and share it with a friend.--The main point I wanna get across in this post is that you can breakdown tricks into simple and easy to consume steps. I use to huck and hope I land tricks, and that lead me to break my back. Yes, sometimes you have to go for it but need the skills, experience, and body positions to lead to repeatable success. --1) Find a run with a little pitch and soft conditions. Also, look around and make sure you're not in a blind spot or someplace someone won't see you. --2) Gain a little speed by pointing your board down the fall line. When you're ready to start the trick, rotate your board across the hill and then immideditly swing your legs to either land on the nose or tail. You'll notice that my center of mass stays in one place while my legs shift and flex/extend underneath. --3) After shifting your weight over the tail or nose, make sure your center of mass is over the respective binding. You will need to find the balance point for your specific board and flex patern. Whatever end you're pressing, exaggerate the flexion of that knee while keeping your spine relatively verticle. It also helps to keep your head up, and eyes are looking 8 feet ahead of you. --4) You can hold the pass for a while or find the flow by hopping from one side to the other fast. --5) When you wanna switch up the press, extend the leg your pressing and then swing your board under your hips and then exaggerate the flexion of the leg your landing on. Again, notice how my lower body does all the work.--6) Repeat this as much as you want or can. --7) When you wanna end this trick, pop off the knee that's being pressed and rotate your hips, shoulders, and board down the fall line. You may need to use counter rotataion to get the board down the fall line.

Try this the next time you ride and don't forget to save this post plus share it with a friend. --Tail presses are a super simple trick if you follow the right steps and have good body positions. The camber profile you have will also play a part in doing tail/ nose presses and butter. I'm using a traditional camber board. Its called the 149 Chillum from @telossnowboards. Def scope out their selection my doods. --1) One of the most important parts about a tail press other than the tail press its self is staying balanced and riding straight. If you want to translate this trick into a rail or box, you have to be in a balanced position, so you don't fall off the rail. Take your lead shoulder, hips, and board, and make sure they are all pointed in the same direction.--2) Shift your center of mass pack your back binding by flexing your back knee, pushing your hip and spine back towards the tail. This combination of movements will help get the nose of your board to rise. Remember, keep your shoulders pointed down the fill to prevent unwanted rotation. --3) You will need to experiment with step 2 to find out how far you can/need to go. In the early stages of learning a tail press, hold this position for a 3 count. After you are killing it, try holding this for a 5 or 10 count. This will really test your balance and ensure you have the right positions. --4) If you want a bit of a challenge, try swinging your hips and back foot. This will make the tail press a bit harder and develop your skill/ balance. This is a fun little challenge. --5) When you want to end the tail press, you can either pop or shift back to a centered position. --I hope you liked this breakdown my doods!--#Snow #snowboarding #snowboardtricks #vans #vanssnowboarding #Patagonia  #snowboarders #tailpress #thisisfun #woodward #copper #skiresort #tricks #yewww",

In today's breakdown, I talk about how to maximize your ollie and ride over crazy chunks of ice. Save this post and let me know what you think of this breakdown!--1) The first thing is making sure you have enough momentum to get your center of mass up and over the feature. Next, make sure you've lined up straight about 3-4 board lengths before hitting the feature. After you dial the speed, all you want to focus on is getting up and over, not speed management. --2) Keep your eyes locked onto the top of the obsticle because this will help your body positions and, more importantly, your timing. If your eyes are on the ground, you're blind to the feature, and that's a huge disadvantage. --3) While riding into, on top and over the obstacle, your shoulders, hips, and board all need to be stacked to maintain balance and control. aggressively flexed your knees and keep your spine upright. --4) As you're approaching the feature, aim to hit as close to the top as you can. You do this by creating the most powerful ollie as possible. Shift your center of mass back by flexing your back knee and aggressively retract your lead knee. This combination of movements will build pressure on your board and then rapidly extend your back leg to catch the air. --4) After you ollie, keep the nose of your board up and expect the impact. If your nose is flat or down, you will run into it like a wall vs. riding up and over. --5) As you impact the ice chunk, retract your knees, so your center of mass goes over the top. This will be abrupt, so be ready. Also, keep your lead shoulder pointed straight over the top and not open. --6) As you make it to the top, the trick is not over. Next, you gotta retract your lead knee and lean back to get the nose of your board to rise. This will help you ride off the top without catching your nose on the way down. --Kinda crazy, right?

As your board is across the fall line, bend your knees a little and get a ready push off the ground.--3) once you're ready to throw the trick, rapidly extend your knees while aggressively lifting up your toes. The goal is to build pressure and then explode up in the air rapidly. --4) Right before catching air, throw your back shoulder in the opposite direction while shifting your weight slightly over your lead foot. This combination will help create air and rotational momentual, but it has to be aggressive--5) After throwing the trick and catching air, drive your eyes and try to spot the landing. Most people want to look down at their feet, but that will restrict your rotation. Keep your chest and eyes up.--6) Retract your knees as much as possible while you're rotating.

Yewww!--When you're carving your snowboard, you don't always have to lean crazy hard into the turn. Turn like the ones in the video translate into spinning off of jumps, traversing catwalks, sending side hit, and more. This style of carve allows you to carve while remaining in a verticle balanced position if done right. Did I forget any examples? Let me know--Let's talk about why this turn is different than more carve turns. Notice that I switch edges really fast while my center of mass barely moves. My legs are pushing away from my body, then retracting and then pushing away again. The closer the movement is to the board, the faster the response, hence why this is fast.--1) Find a run that you're comfortable with and gain some speed. Too much speed will make this hard, and too little speed will be hard to balance. --2) Point the nose of your board down the fall line. Right before you start carving, sink your center of mass down. This step is important to get your board to move quickly, as we discussed in the 3rd paragraph. --3) Keep your shoulders and hip pointed down the hill and let your legs do the work.--4) Toeside carve Initiate the toeside carve by pushing both your knees over your toes while not raising your center of mass. Be sure to press both knees eqaully to prevent any skidding. The harder you press, the more aggressive the turn will be. --5) As you're finishing the turn, release the pressure of the shins. Next, repidly lift up your toes and apply pressure to the highback of your bindings. Extend your knees away from your body but remember, you're not trying to raise your center of mass. Rewatch the video and notice how my board is not under my body but off to the ride. --6) Play with the timing of these movements and find the flow of the turns.

I don't want you to be mocking into this trick or going to slow. Also, find a slope that is relatively smooth and forgiving. I don't want you to get wrecked out there. --2) When you're ready to do the trick, begin to shift your legs/board forward and your hips back. As you're starting to apply pressure to the back of your board, flex your back knee and get your backside as close to the ground as possible. The goal is to get the center of mass close to the ground in a controlled manner.--3) Next, reach for the ground with both arms while keeping your board pointed down the hill. At this point, you will have a bit of upper and lower body separation. --4) As you're in this position, maintain your balance with your hand and keep your core tight to hold this position. Hold this trick as long as its safe, and you have momentium. --5) You have a few options here, like just standing straight up or spinning out. For this breakdown, I'll talk about the 180 out. --6) Once you're ready to 180 out, extend your back leg, and raise your hips towards the sky. As you extend your back leg, your board will become more verticle and maneuverable. --7) Swing the toes of your lead leg towards the ground. This simple movement will initiate the spin. As your board is spinning, push off the ground and get your center of mass over your board. --8) continue to swing your lead leg underneath your board and stand up. I admit that the 180 out was a bit skidded around. Ideally, you'll be able to get the 180 around clean.

Tune in to see if I pick your video! --You def need to know how to maximize the performance from your board and body while having some precise movements. You really want to get your body and board to work together. You will get more snap out of a camber board, but you can still achieve this trick on most snowboards. --Let me know if you want me to breakdown how to ollie super high. For now, let's breakdown this video. --1) Find a rail that's when in your comfort zone. I like doing this kinda trick on a round rail and on the last 3rd of the feature. --2) Come into the rail with about a 30-degree angle and ollie high enough so you hit the side of the rail. As you hit the side of the rail, you wanna redirect your momentum towards the end of the rail. You will need to rotate your board 30 degrees to get the most amount of contact with the rail. --3) After you hit the rail, shift your weight towards the back of your board and begin to throw your lead shoulder in the frontside direction. --4) As the nose of your board leaves the rail, retract your leading knee and ollie off the rail. By ollieing off the rail, you will give yourself more air, thus having more time to get the rotation around. --5) Drive your shoulders as much as you can, but around the 270-degree mark, you will need to accelerate your lower body, so your board completes the 360. You can accelerate your lower rotating your hip and scissoring your legs. Scissoring your legs is when your legs move in opposite directions to get the board to rotate. --6) Land on your toeside edge and absorb the impact with both of your knees. --#snowboarding #Snow #tricks #snowboardingisfun #snowboardtricks #snowboarders #colorado #snowing #winter #tricksarefun #noseblocks #tomieb1",

I like doing a toeside turn up the hill because I'm able to see where I'm doing, and that helps set me up for success. --2) Ride up the hill with the intention of coming straight back down in almost a perfectly straight line. This thought process will help prevent you from doing unwanted spins. --3) Get low and right before you hit your apex, jump up really hard. As you're jumping up, retract your lead knee up and extend your back knee down. This will get the board to become more verticle. As your board is verticle, shift your center of mass over your tail and grab the nose of your snowboard.--4) If your center of mass is too far back or forward, it will be tough to find that perfect balancing point. If you're unable to find the balance point, be careful of the board spitting you out and crashing. --5) Hold the block as long as you can and when you feel your body is losing balance, let go of the grab. Try to land with both feet at the same time in a stacked position. You may be riding down the bank switch so simply turn your head and then come to a stop of needed. --6) Ride Away like a boss!--#snowboarding #Snow #tricks #snowboardingisfun #snowboardtricks #snowboarders #colorado #snowing #winter #tricksarefun #noseblocks #tommieb1",

        "description": "Have you ever hit a feature like this? Let me know in the comments below and save this post for the next time you go #snowboarding--I suggest being comfortable with urban style rails before hitting a feature like this. I have a few breakdowns of how to urban on. HMU if you want me to share those posts.--1) Ride into the feature with a trajectory of about 15-20 degrees. As you're riding up the jump to the rail, pop enough to get your center of mass on top of the feature. I like to keep my eyes locked on the end of the rail. This will help you get to the end of the rail. If you look down, it's easy to shift your center of mass off the side of the feature. Also, If you're lead shoulder is open, it's easy to fall off the other way. Keep those eyes and shoulders pointed at the end of the rail. --2) Lift up your toes and let your board hit the side of the rail just slightly. By doing this, you'll help redirect your momentum down the rail. --3) Once you're on the rail, keep your knees bent and be ready for the drop. The drop is not that gnarly if you're in a strong and athletic body position. If you're twisted or outta balance, the drop will amplify that body position. --4) As you hit the waterfall/drop, extend your knees to make contact with the rail faster. Notice how my belly button stayed relatively in the same spot? After making contact with the rail, absorb the impact, and maintain your balance. As you are on the second rail, keep your shoulder, hips, and board pointed at the end of the rail.--5) Ride through the end of the rail and feel like a boss!--#snow #snowboard #snowboarder #springtime #park #terrainpark #parkdays #sunnyandsick #sunnyparkdays #woodward #woodwardcopper #purlwax #telossnowboard",

This advanced drill helps you with explosive power, understanding weight distribution, edge control, and so much more. Let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried or seen this. --I suggest you work on your 180's, carving, and riding switch before attempting this drill. --1) When it comes to this drill, You can do them more down the hill, across the hill, or a blend. The more you travel straight down the fall line, the more you will pick up speed.--2) Start your normal direction in a toeside carve. As you're in the carve, begin to sink down and get ready to pop or ollie. I suggest starting with what's most comfortable between pop and ollie. --3) When you're ready to spin the 180, I like taking my back shoulder and driving that shoulder the 180 degrees. As I drive the shoulder, you'll notice that the rest of my body follows. I like this tactic because it helps set me up in a more stacked and powerful position. If my NEW lead shoulder is too twisted open, it will make this trick way harder. --4) Retract your knees once you're in the air to help get the rotation around. Most importantly, shift your weight over your new toeside and land in a carved turn. By shifting your weight over your toe side edge, it will help you get those sick, aggressive turns. --5) Perform a sick gnarly carve and repeat the steps switch.--6) Start with 1 set of toe to toes and then increase the number of sets as you get comfortable. Find the flow and use the snow to you're advantage. If you see a small bump in the snow, feel free to pop off that to help get some more air. --Bonus: You can place your hand on the ground for style/balance/ confidence builder. I like sinking down and touching the snow.

If you're struggling with carves, Dm and I'll send you a carving beginners guide. --1) Find a run that has lots of space and no one around. As you're doing this carve, you will be traveling across the fall line, so watch out for traffic. Going too fast or too slow can make this super challenging as well.--2) Gain some speed and start a toe side carve. Once you have locked in your carve, sink down by flexing your knees and place your hand on the ground. The key is to get your center of mass close to the ground and lean over. --3) Once your hands are on the ground, extend your legs away from your lower body. The more you extend, the lower body, the closer you will be to the ground. The most common problem with this step is keeping your toeside edge engaged. I suggest doing dorsiflexion of your ankles to lock in that edge. --4) As you're laying out the carve, keep your core tight and hands on the ground. Hold this position as long as you have momentum and control.--5) Once you're ready to exit the carve, retract your knees and get your legs under your center of mass. --6) I wanted to add a bit of my freestyle in the mix, so I tossed a backside 3 at the end. If you wanna add a backside 3, take your lead shoulder and throw in the backside direction as you're standing up.

        "description": "Finding natural gaps like this is one of my favorite things ever. Share and save this post, my doods! Yewww--As you're riding around looking for gaps, keep these few tips in mind. Look for a place that provides you with enough speed into it and a run out that you can handle. Next, you're looking for some sort of up transition/ jump that is within your ability level. Arguably the most important part is calculating the speed, pop, and trajectory. This skill comes from practice, experience, and reading these posts lol. I'll go deeper into pop and speed in the steps below.--1) I spotted this gap the run before so, I had a chance to spot the takeoff, the landing, and determine exactly what I needed to do. I took another lap and hit the gap.--2) As I was riding into the gap with a good amount of speed. I knew exactly where I wanted to take off and land, but sometimes that isn't enough. As I was riding up to the lip, I was looking at the landing at the last second and processed as much info as possible. I have my knees bent and ready to make any last minute changes.  At this time, I had the option to change my angle of approach or trajectory.--The previous step takes lots of experience and trial and error. It's helpful if you watch someone do it, and you can take a similar approach. I know this is not always the case but can be super helpful. Also, start small and build your confidence/skills.--3) Once you're in the air, retract your knee. By retracting your knees, you will have more balanced/ control, and it will help you stay composed. Also, focus on where you will land vs. looking straight down. --4) I noticed that I was about to land on a weird double fall line. I knew that my momentum was taking me into the trees; therefore, I shifted my weight over my heelside edge. I also rotated my board to redirect my path and stay in control. --5) Next, I landed on a heelside edge and absorbed the bumps in the landing. Throughout the trick, you have to constantly make adjustments, so be in a position that allows that. -#Snowboard #snowboarding #snowboard4life #snowboardingforlife #snowboards #snowing #snow #colorado #letsdothis #Copper",

Save this post and share it with a friend. Yewww--Finding the right feature is key here. You can perform this trick on almost anything like a rail or box. Today, I'll be breaking down the feature in the video above. --1) Ride into the feature with about at 15 degree trajectory so, you're aimed at the rail but not too aggressively. Next, pop hard enough that you're landing slightly on the side near the top of the rail.--2) As you hit the side of the feature, redirect your momentum down the rail. Also, keep your eyes/ shoulder pointed down the rail to help maintain your balance. --3) Keep your belly button stacked directly over the rail and make micro adjustments as needed. Keep your knees bent and be ready to pop for the next step. --4) As you get closer to the end of the feature, shift your weight back, retract your lead knee, and do an ollie. I like to do an ollie in this situation because it helps rail your nose of your board, and thats easier for the tap.--5) For the tap, I retract my back knee, and that will cause the nose of the board to pivot down. You can extend your lead knee, but be cautious that you don't lean forward or lose balance. Rewatch that part to get a better understanding. --6) As you tap the feature with your nose but absorb the impact by retracting your knee so you don't get unbalanced. --7) After tapping your nose, get ready to land the trick and ride away like a boss -#Snowboarding #Snowboarder #snowboarders #Snowboard #snowboards #snowing #snow #colorado #letsdothis #Copper #copperwoodward",

Am I missing anything, let me know below.--2) I like approaching side hit with my front side facing the jump and popping off a slight toeside edge.--3) As you take off the lip, make sure you're lined up to where you wanna land. I take a straight forward trajectory.--4) I'm sinking down and then extending both my knees as I hit the face of the jump. I want my weight centered over my board to help stay balanced in the air. --5) As you're in the air, retract your knees towards your chest, and that will get the board closer to your hand. As your board is close to your hand, grab the board and kick out your back foot. Also, keep your shoulders pointed at the landing.--6) Let go of the grab and rotate your hips and board back to align with your shoulders.

If you're struggling to learn your first carve, shoot me a dm, and I'll send you a sick how to carve video. --First, let's define a carve. A carve is creating a turn by using your radial sidecut while having the tail follow the exact path of the nose. This turn shoulder is significantly quieter than a skidded turn. The easiest way to know if you're carving is to look back in the snow and see if you have created a pencil thin line in the snow. --Ok, Let's break it down my doods!--Tip #1: Overall, with the carves in the video, you will notice that I'm sinking my center of mass down and low to the ground. I think about sinking down and then inclination towards the hillside. I don't want you to drop your chest and lean over but rather get low by using your knees. This technique makes you feel super stable and confident because you're close to the ground.--Tip #2: When you're super low, try putting your hand on the ground, it feels fantastic and looks super cool. More importantly, putting your hand on the ground is a test to see how your balance is in a slow position.--Tip #3: To lock in your toes side carve, pushing both knees over your toes. This will add extra tilt to your board. After you have them locked in, experiment with pushing your knees over your toes at different times and intensities. --Tip #4: On a heelside carve, lift up all of your toes to add more tilt to the board, and this will help you lock in that heelside edge. You can also try adding forward lean for more responsiveness. --Tip #5: For quick edge changes, finish your turn with more weight on the tail of your board and shift your weight forward before the start of the next turn. When you start slightly forward on your next turn, your board will grip the snow for early edge engagements. Stay low to the ground, so you don't waste time standing up and sinking back down. --Tip #6: Be creative and have fun!--#Snowboarding #telossnowboards #carving #snowboardcarving #ryannknapton #killing it #snowboarders #snowboards #snowboardhowto #howtosnowboard #snow #snowing",

I might be cruising around...--This trick will be easier if you have frontside 360's out and backside blunts. I suggest getting those on lock for sure. --1) Find a feature that is within your comfort zone and drop off at the end of the rail. The drop off will give you extra time to get the trick around. hit the feature a few times and dial in the speed before doing the trick. --2) Ride into the rail with your back facing the rail or ride straight in. Wind up your shoulders and do a slight heelside turn into the feature. The heelside turn will help create rotational momentum in combination with your shoulders. --3) As you leave the jump, rotate your board and shoulders 90 degrees on the rail and then immediately absorb the impact as you get on the rail. Make sure your weight is on your back foot and in a balanced position. --4) As you're on the rail, you want to keep your board and lower body at 90 degrees on the rail and your shoulder, continuing the rotation in the frontside direction. To achieve the upper and lower body separation, keep your core disengaged. If your core is tight, your lower and upper body will rotate as one resulting on you spinning on the rail. --5) Continue rotating your shoulders and keep your back knee bent. As you get to the end of the rail, you want to explode off the back foot and let the lower body catch up to the shoulders. --6) Your lower body will catch up, but you may not have enough rotation to complete the full 270 out. Rotate the lower body with a scissor movement and get the nose of your board pointed down the hill. If your shoulders are left behind a bit, that's ok as long as it doesn't hinder the rotation. --As your board touches the ground, get on your toe side edge to prevent any unwanted rotation, and then let the shoulders catch up. --Ride away and keep killing it!--#snowboard #snowboarding #snowboardlife #snowboardaddiction #stanceSocks #purlwax #rider #snowboarding #colorado #terrainpark #backside #270 #snowboardtricks",

Also, find some jumps that are within your ability level so you can focus on the movements without adding a bunch of fear into the mix--1) I like to do 1 or 3 edge rolls as I go into the jump depending on the speed. I suggest taking off of your heel side edge when your first learn because of your turning and throwing in the same direction. This will make the spin feel natural and easier. If you're looking for a challenge, take off on your toes, but that will be a separate breakdown. --2a) For the first 180, close your lead shoulder and get low. As you're riding up the take off extend your legs and throw your lead shoulder. Notice that my back shoulder completes the 180 first, and then the rest of my body follows. I like doing this because I can control how slow my lower body rotates, and I can time my lower body to land right at 180 degrees. --2b) The landing: As you're rotating the 180, you're staying composed and balanced in the air. The goal is to land with both feet at the same time. Traditional when landing switch, most snowboarders are overwhelmed with fear. This fear will put you in a less ideal landing position, which is your weight over the back foot and your hands reaching for the ground. Land with a strong and stacked position.--Bonus: When you're riding switch, perform 10 to 20 ollies with your chest up and landing with both feet at the same time. This drill will help reinforce a strong body position and build confidence for landing switch. --3a) Repeat the same sequence as step 2.--3b) As you take off the lip switch, think about your weight centered, control the pop, chest up, and look down the hill to spot your landing.

On Tuesday, I'm introducing a new youtube series where I breakdown 3 random videos and then do a live Q & A. Dm a video and tune in Tuesday to see if I breakdown your video. What should I call this web series?--1) I suggest finding a fat tube that's low to the ground. This feature will minimize the consequences while increasing confidence. --2) This is called a frontside 5050 because you're entering the rail with the front side of your body is facing the rail. --3) As you're riding up to the feature, take a small toeside turn and ride into the feature with about a 15 20 degree trajectory. Most urban on features will not allow you to ride directly onto them. With this trajectory, you angle your way onto the rail. --4) This next part gets a bit complicated, so I suggest watching the video a few times to understand it truly. You want to aim your board side of the rail a bit, not directly on top. If you land on top, it's really hard to redirect your momentum down the rail.--5) As you hit the side of the rail, your momentum will be redirected down the rail and then gently roll your board on top of the feature by lifting your toes and then even them out. This is a fine motor skill but extremely practical. --6) As you're riding the rail, keep your knee bent and make fine adjustments as needed. A quick piece of feedback is, if you're falling off the rail, it could be one of the following A) Your lead shoulder is open, causing you to be unbalanced. B) Your Bellybutton is not directly over the rail. C) you jumped over the rail too much or too little. D) You didn't redirect the momentum enough or too much. E) You didn't jump high enough.

Link In Bio--Snow sprays are a result of a high edge angle and a significant amount of pressure. This concept is simple, but it can also be an expression of your creativity. Are you creative with your sprays? --1) For this specific spray, I express my creativity by adding a 270 in the beginning. You have the option to start regular or switch, but you wanna spin in the frontside direction and spray with your toeside edge. --2) To initiate the 270, wind up and throw your lead shoulder while lifting up your toes. Lifting up your toes will help you prevent an edge catch while rotating. --3) Continue rotating the first 180 degrees with your upper body and lower body. Next, keep your shoulders at 180 degrees and continue your lower body 270 degrees. You wanna keep your shoulders at 180, so it will help you pull back the rotation vs. continuing the spin.--4) As you rotate your lower body the last 90 degrees, lift up your toes, so you don't catch an edge. Also, When your lower body hits the 270 mark, make sure you're increasing the pressure on your toe side edge. The more tilt and pressure you apply, the bigger the spay will be. Keep your center of mass leaning up the hill as well--5) Shoot up some spray, but don't lose all of your speed. You wanna have enough momentum to ride out and keep going. If you overpressure, you can end up falling over or losing all of your speed, and its not fun. lol--Ride away and kill it! --#Snowboarders #stancesocks #vanssnow #riding #treeriding #trees #colorado #awesome #killingit#snowboarding #snowboarders #snowboarding #snowboardtricks #snowboard #moguls #youtube #snowing #snowboard4life #snowboard #Snowboards #snow #snowboardtrickz #gopro #gopro8 #snow #winter",

Also, subscribe to my Youtube Channel for more in depth videos. link in bio--Hitting boxes like this is a lot easier than hitting crazy rails. I def suggest that you start with boxes then moving on. --1) Find a feature that you think is within your ability level. --2) Next, watch at least 3 people hit the feature. I use this tactic all the time! As I'm watching people hit the feature, I study their body positions, how much speed they take into the box, and I'm looking to see if the feature throws the rider in a weird position. --3) With this specific box, you can hit it straight on. I didn't have to hit it from the side, and that makes this rail super simple. --4) As you ride into a feature straight on, make sure you are line straight into it. I like to ride flat base into the rail, so I'm less likely to do unnecessary direction changes. --5) As you ride up the jump, slightly pop so, you're able to control how much air you will get. My goal is to land with both feet at the same time, so I retract my back knee and try to match the angle of the landing. --6) This step is essential. As I ride through the feature, I'm trying to keep my belly button in the same place and let my legs flex/extend. This tactic allows my legs to absorb the rollers of the box without losing balance. --7) At the end of the box, you have the option to either absorb or pop. I like popping off the end, adding a bit of flair to my riding.--As you're on a crazy feature like this, you will continuously be making micro adjustments. I recommend that you have a friend film you see how you can make the rail look better. --Are you subscribe to the youtube channel yet?--#Snowboarding #snowboard #snowboarder #snowboarders #snowboardtricks #snowboardtrickz #snow #snowing #winter",

        "description": "Do you struggle to ride the trees? Scope out this post, SAVE, and tell a friend! --In this post, I'll give you my favorite tips and tricks to riding trees like a boss.  Comment down below if I miss anything!--Tip # 1: Find the right trees for your skill level. Find the right trees can be an art. You're looking for a tree that is spaced out enough so you have time to complete the turn and stay in control. Also, you want to make sure the tree run has just the right amount of pitch. Not too steep but def not too flat.Tip # 2: Anticipate your turn my pointing your shoulders in the direction you want to travel. If your shoulder is pointed in the opposing direction, your turns can be delayed, and you may run into a tree. Not sick, right?--Tip #3: If you wanna make smaller turns, use the tactic of knee steering. This means shifting your weight over your front foot. When you do a toeside turn, press your knee over your toes to start the turn. On heelside turns, open your knee towards the nose of your snowboard. These tactics will help you make smaller turns, and that's ideal for trees. --Tip #4: When you're riding trees with no new snow, the trails will make small bank turns. Ride these banks to turn faster or find the flow.--Tip #5: When you're board is pointed across the fall line, and you're skidding your turns, you will slow down. Use this tactic when it's super steep. --Tip #6: Look up and plan your turns. As you're riding trees, you need to process information fast. You want to look up and plan your path as soon as possible. --Tip #7: Don't stare at the tree. The key to riding trees and not running into them is to look around the tree. You go where you look, don't look at the trees. It's kind of like BirdBox. lol--What is your favorite step? let me know!--#Snowboarders #stancesocks #vanssnow #riding #treeriding #trees #colorado #awesome #killingit #love#snowboarding #snowboarding #snowboardtricks #snowboard #moguls #youtube @youtube #snowing #snowboard4life #snowboard #snowboardtrickz #gopro #gopro8 #winter #cliffdropping #cliffs",

Snowboarding is a creative expression for me, what is snowboarding to you?--Thanks, @johnathanbuckhouse, for filming my dood!--Backside shifties are so freaking fun, but make sure you're comfortable with popping/ollies and being in the air. Let's get into it!--1) Find a side hit, moguls, or a jump to practice this trick. --2) As you head into the jump, keep your spine relatively verticle and your shoulders, hips, and knees stacked over your board. With moguls, you gotta keep your knees flexed so you can absorb the terrain as needed. --3) Notice that I'm absorbing the downside of the bump while getting prepared to pop off the next jump. This is def a matter of timing and body position. I have to wait to ride up the jump before I'm able to pop. If you mistime this, you'll be out of balance or jeopardize your air time. --4) I take off the jump with a flat base while traveling slightly across this hill. I'm specifically going towards the right because I found a good place to land. --5) Once you're in the air, begin, you rotate your lead hip 45 degrees in the backside direction. As you're rotating your hips, extend your lead foot while slightly kicking your back heel towards your butt. Keep your shoulders pointed down the hill.--6) Hold this position as long as you can and then leg your lower body align back up with your shoulders. It would help if you got back to a stacked position before you touch the ground. --7) As you touch the ground, absorb the impact like you're landing on eggshells, and you don't want to break any of them. It would help if you did this on the majority of your landings. --Yewww!!!! --#snowboarding #snowboarders #snowboarding #letsdothis #snowboardtricks #snowboard #moguls #youtube @youtube #snowing #snowboard4life #snowboard #Snowboards #snow #snowboardtrickz #gopro #gopro8 #snow #winter #cliffdropping #cliffs",

I used the first cliff as a buy in to get ready for the second cliff. I didn't want to have to much speed and not be able to handle it. you'll notice that I slightly speed check as I drop the first cliff. --1)I checked out the two cliffs and made a plan on how I was going to hit it. Now, let's break down the second cliff. After absorbing the impact of the first cliff, get ready to pop off the second one. --2a) The key to dropping cliffs is reading the conditions and the terrain. Keep your body in a stacked position, so you're ready to do just about anything. As you're getting close to the cliff, you're looking at the take off to see how soft or firm it is. Use that information to make the appropriate decision and use the right body movements to be successful. --2b) I notice the take off has been hit before, so I can tell its been packed down. I use this information and give myself a little pop off the cliff. Immediately after popping, I grabbed my snowboard to help keep my body in control and to improve the vid look a bit cooler. haha. --3) As I grab my snowboard, I'm looking down at the landing and processing as much info as possible. I notice that the landing is kinda soft but not untouched. I slightly shift my weight back so I can keep the nose of my board up but not too much. I try to absorb the impact as much as possible while staying in control. --4) As I land, I'm trying to slow down as soon as possible without crashing. I def didn't wanna hit the trees down below. Keep your knees bend and stay in contact to slow down faster. --Yewww!---#snowboarding #snowboarders #snowboarding #letsdothis #snowboardtricks #snowboard #woodwardcopper #woodward #copper #coppermountain #copperresort #Telossnowboards #snow #snowboardtrickz #gopro #gopro8 #snow #winter #cliffdropping #cliffs",

Check out the link in bio for an indept video on how to do tricks outside the park!--1) Riding close to the trees, you're likely to find little side hits like these. I suggest hitting the jump away from the trees, not towards them. --2) After you find a side hit, dial in your turns, so you're taking off a heelside edge. This heelside edge take off will help you start the rotation. --3) You may find cab 180's intutive because your body will naturally fight to land your dominate direction. This can be a great option for your first 180.  Get ready to pop the 180 by getting low and winding up your shoulders. --4) As you're riding up the side jump, throw your lead shoulder in the frontside direction. I like to time the pop so I'm leaving off the last part of my tail. This helps me maximize air and distance. --5) As you're in the air, retract your knees and keep your eyes looking at the landing, not your feet. I take my new lead shoulder and point it at the landing. You'll notice that I throw the shoulder kinda hard and then control the rotation of the lower body. --6) I get my board to point down the fall line right as I land the 180 along with my shoulders. I like landing with my shoulders, hips and knees stacked over eachother. This position will help you absorb the terrain because I'm using more body parts to handle the impact. --7) Ride Away like a boss--Did you submit your clip yet? --#snowboarder #youtube #snowboarding #snowboard #snowing #terrainparks #letsdothis #woodwardcopper #copper #coppermountain #thankyouparkcrew #readytorip #fullsend #vanssnow #vans #burtonboots  #patagoina #snowboard4life #snowboarderforlife #snowboardtrip #colorado #spinning #telossnowboards",

One of the hardest parts of this trick is finding the right feature. Head to @woodwardcopper if you wanna hit this exact feature!--1) After finding the right feature, you gotta dial in the speed to hit the feature. You don't want to much or too little. --2) Being a regular rider and this feature is on the left side of the hill. I set up on a heelside edge. As I'm turning into the feature, I'm constantly adjusting my speed. --3) As you're riding up the transition, begin winding up your shoulder and flexing your knees. Throw your shoulders and begin the rotation as you're going off the lip of the jump. --4) Notice that I'm not jumping on to the feature but slightingly hitting the front. I'm doing this because I need to stop my momentum from going over the feature. The key is to throw the spin and hit the feature without losing your balance. AND... You gotta know where you are in your rotation as well, so you can be prepared for getting off the rail. --5) After redirecting your momentum, look over your lead shoulder and engage your core extremely tight. When you engage your core, your upper body and lower body will stay connected and help keep the rotation going.--6) Continue spinning until you lose balance, momentum, or you choose to hop off. This aspect can be really challenging, so keep your knees balanced and be ready for anything. --7) As you're sliding off the feature or ready to hope off. Shift your weight off the feature and ride away.--#snowboarder #youtube #snowboarding #snowboard #snowing #terrainparks #letsdothis #woodwardcopper #copper #coppermountain #thankyouparkcrew #readytorip #fullsend #vanssnow #vans #burtonboots  #patagoina #snowboard4life #snowboarderforlife #snowboardtrip #colorado #spinning #TelosSnowboards",

Tree taps can help you learn independent flexion and extension of the lower extremities, and that helps learn crazy grabs like a seatbelt... Save this post and study it on the chairlift next time you ride. --1) You'll notice that there is a trail leading into the tree and made a divot in the snow. You want to hit the trail relatively perpendicular as a jump. A big thing about snowboarding is keeping your head up and looking around. You want to be looking for people, danger and of course stuff to play on. If your eyes are locked down at your feet, it's nearly impossible to see all those obstacles. --2) This jump can exceptionally quickly, so make sure your body positions are on point. Find a jump or side hit that's within your ability level.  Ride into the feature with a decent amount of speed and get into a flexed/popping position. --3) As far as lining up to tap the underside of the tree branch, I like to keep my body about 2 feet away from the tree. The goal is to hit the tree branch, no the tree. Aim for outside of the tree and at the branch. --4) As you're riding up the face of the \"jump\", begin to extend your knees while keeping your lead shoulder pointing in the direction you're traveling. You will need to adjust how much you pop, depending on the jump and how big you want to go.--5) Once you're in the air, exaggerate the flexion of your back knee up and across to your lead shoulder while extending your lead leg. This will naturally get the tail of your board higher in the air. I also rotate my hips about 60 degrees and close my shoulders equally. This counter rotation will help prevent me from unwanted rotating and landing sideways. --6) If you're feeling a bit outta balance, you may need to counter that by shifting your spine slightly back.--7) TAP the tree gently and then move the upper body and lower body back to a centered and aligned position.--8) Land and ride away! --#Snowboarding #Snow #snowboardtricks #snowboardlife #snowboardtrip #skiresort #snowing #winter #riding #snowboard #Snowboardingtricks #snowboardingtrickz #snowboardbutters #snowboardvlog #howtosnowboard #telosSnowboards",

Do this whatever is more natural or intuitive to you. --2) As your riding and ready to do this trick, begin to flex your knees and hips slightly while winding up your lead shoulder. Notice that I not over exaggerating either of these movements? You are essentially up unweighting your board and timing your rotation just right. --3) After you sink down, begin to shift your center of mass over your back foot by extending your lead knee and flexing your back knee. The more aggressively you do this movement, the more you will shift your weight back. Perform these steps with the intensity to get the nose of your board in the air. Also, throw your shoulders in the frontside direction to initiate the rotation. --4) As your board gets in the air, allow your lead shoulder to drive the rotation but engage your core to keep the upper body and lower body connected. --5) To control the press, think about keeping your belly button over the end of the board and retract the knee that's in the air. This is def a balancing act, so keep your movements intentional. --6) Right around the 90-degree mark, your nose might be coming down, so the next movements have to be fast. Push your new lead foot down the hill while sweeping the back of your board back underneath your center of mass. Each leg does about half the work, thus making this movement fast. If you're slow with this, you increase your chances of getting an edge, and we all know that's not fun. --7)  If your upper body counter rotates a bit, that's fine, as long as the counter rotation doesn't hinder the rotation. --Again submit your clips!--#Snowboarding #Snow #snowboardtricks #snowboardlife #snowboardtrip #skiresort #snowing #winter #riding #snowboard #Snowboardingtricks #snowboardingtrickz #snowboardbutters #snowboardvlog #howtosnowboard #cvlogs #telosSnowboards",

Also, watch out for people, so you don't get wrecked.--1) Ride into the side hit with as much speed as you're comfortable with. I like to go a bit slower into jumps and popping more, but that's just me.--2) I take a wide sweeping turn into this side hit. As I'm cutting across the run, I'm looking around to make sure the area is clear of people. --3) As I cut across the hill, I'm on my toeside edge. I begin to flex my knees to get ready to pop. Notice as I take off the jump, I'm extending both my knees at the same time. I like using pop in these kinds of situations because I can remain in a strong and balanced position. If I was to aggressively retract my lead knee and do an ollie, I could get catapulted forward or get out of balance. --4) Once I'm in the air, I retract my knees and grab my snowboard with my backhand. Make sure you're grabbing between the bindings my doods. Trust me. --5) To add the Indy tweak, simply take your back leg and extend it down the hill. You may need to rotate your hips a bit but keep your lead shoulder pointed towards the landing to bring the rotation back. --6) Let go of the grab and extend your legs towards the ground.

By popping, I was able to control exactly where I was going to land. --4) After popping off the little lip, I kept my shoulders, hips, and board all pointed in the same direction.

This allows me to distribute the impact between both knees. --Bonus: If there were 15 inches of pow in the landing, I would not use this tactic.

I have some sick stickers and hoodies for sale. Dm if you want to check them out. --The most important step to learning how to ride up a tree is finding the right tree. You wanna find a tree that you can take a toe side turn into. Next,  The tree you're looking for has snow build up just like a quarter pipe. This transition will be quick but necessary at first. --1a) Take a wide sweeping turn into the tree. As you're cutting across the hill, make sure you're looking uphill and don't cut anyone off. --1b) For your first attempt, I recommend only taking enough speed that gets allows your nose just to touch the tree. Please do this to understand what you're getting into. This trick takes extreme focus and precise movements--2) Now let's breakdown the trick. Right before riding up the tree, flex both of your knees then extend them as you start to ride up the transition. Next, shift your center of mass back over your tail. Notice how I keep my body stacked and board pointed straight up while going up the tree? You want all your momentum and movements go work together. --3) As you're riding up the tree, slightly absorb the impact and allow your board, hips, and shoulders to be almost parallel to the tree. By doing that, it will help you ride up the tree without falling off. The more speed you have, the higher you will ride up the tree, but the higher the consequences will be.--4) As I hit the apex, I get my body ready to pop a backside 180 out by slightly shifting weight over my front foot. Then rotate my lead shoulder towards my tail. I push off the tree to give me enough time to get the spin around. --5) As you're rotating out, you may need to speed up the lower body to get the nose of the board to point down the fall line. --Get your weight evenly over both feet and ride away!--#Snowboarding #snowboarders #Snowboardtrip #snowboardtricks #stancesocks #TelosSnowboards #snowboard4life #snowboardlife #winterpark #ride #Riding #colorado #patagonia @patagonia #snow #snowing",

Also, Huge shoutout to @johnathanbuckhouse for filming this clip!--Reading the Terrain: As you're riding around, you'll see natural rollers, bumps, and side hits. Each bump, jump, or roller provides its unique opportunities for tricks. As you find a natural feature, scope out how much it will kick you in the air, and what the landing looks like. Its necessary to gather as much information as possible and then decide what tricks you can do with the setup. As a general thought, you need to find the right speed and pop for each trick. You may need to hit it a few times to dial in the trick. --The Breakdown: --1) As I'm riding through the trees, I spot this little bump at the edge of the run. I instantly see the tree branch, and I started to create the game plan in my head. I know that I need to handle the run in and get some insane pop.--2) As I get closer to this natural jump, I flex my knees and get ready to pop. Overall my chest remains relatively tall because this will help the center of mass stay balanced.--3) Notice as I hit the bump... I pop. This tactics allows me to keep the steps simple and utilize the natural terrain. You want to time you leaving the bump as late as possible to maximize the trajectory off the bump. --4) This next step takes a lot of spacial awareness. Notice that I'm not looking at the tree, but I know exactly when to hit the tree. Internally you need to know how fast you're traveling and how much time you have until you connect with the tree.-5) Slightly retract your femur up and then kick your heel towards your butt while slightly rotating your hips about 65 degrees in the backside direction. Do this step as fast as possible so you can tap the tree. --6) Hold this position as needed. --7) Keep your shoulders pointed straight ahead and then bring your feet back in alignment. --8) Push your knees out, land, and ride away!--#Snowboarding #snowboarders #Snowboardtrip #snowboardtricks #snowboard4life #snowboardlife #winterpark #ride #Riding #colorado #patagonia @patagonia",

You're looking for a little jump in front of the tree and a decent drop off to give you time to add the rotation. --The Goal is to \"TAP\" the tree NOT smash your board into it. The rotation comes from the shoulder, NOT the bonk. Keep reading to find out how!--1) After you find the right tree, set yourself up with the tree on your front side. Take the right amount of speed into the tree thats slow enough to get the tap but fast enough to get the 360 around. --2) Ride into the tree on your toeside edge with your knees bent so you can get some extra pop and air. --3a) Timing is the biggest key to success on this trick. You want to time the pop, so you're leaving the lip of the jump as late as possible. This allows the nose of your board to clear the tree before you attempt to TAP the tree. As your tail is about to leave the lip, retract your knee up and then towards the tree.--3b) The majority of this rotation comes from driving the back shoulder in the backside direction. As you're creating your pop, start building the rotational momentum. A lot of times with this trick will cause you to counter rotate, but try to minimize this as much as possible because it will cause you to under rotate. If needed, you can touch the tree with your lead hand.--4) After your board taps the tree, spot your landing as soon as possible. By spotting your landing, it will help continue the rotation. Keep your knees retracted to spin fast. If you get too tall in the air, you can slow down and have less control/balance.--5) You want to keep rotating until your board and body has completed the rotation. I think about rotating all the way to my toeside edge. This helps you land in a strong and stacked position. --#snowboarding #winterpark #snow #snowboardtricks #backside360 #colorado #snowing #tricks #Killingit #telossnowboards #snowboard",

Thanks @johnathanbuckhouse for the clip dawg!--I recommend having a backside 3 before attempting this trick. Most snowboards can butter, but some require you to put a lot more effort/pressure to get the board to flex the way you want. --1) I did this backside butter across the hill on my toeside edge, and I found it more comfortable than going straight down the mountain. Also, the more you can keep your spine verticle and chest up, the easier this trick will be. Remember that throughout the steps below. --2) Traverse across the fall line at speed you're comfortable with. Open your lead shoulder and immediately drive the shoulder in the backside direction. Right, when your lead shoulder passes the nose of your board, engage the crap out of your core and pop into a backside 180. With this butter, you want your upper and lower body to rotate as one for most of the rotation, and engaging your core makes this easy to do. --3) As you're rotating the backside 180, shift your weight over your switch tail. You may need to really shift your center of mass over the tip of the board to get the full butter. This step requires constant adjustment to maintain balance but progress smartly into a crazy butter like this. --4) After performing step 3, continue to keep your core tight, weight over the end of your board but get your eyes to spot the landing. This will give you an idea of how much more you have to rotate. --5) As you're rotating the next 90 degrees, keep your weight over the end of your board and retract your opposite knee to increase the butter as needed. At this point, you don't want to overdo it because you might get spit out. --6) To finish the last 90 degrees, keep driving your shoulders in the backside direction, and you want to pull your back heel under your center of mass. This movement has to be fast you so don't catch the nose of your board in the snow! --#Snowboarding #telosSnowboards #butters #Snowboardbutters #snowboarder #PurlWax #snowboardAddiction #SA #tricks",

Let me know below!--Prerequisites: frontside 5050, backside 180s and the ability to ride/ land switch. --1) Find a rail that is within your comfort zone but is also long enough to have time to lock in, swivel, and ride out of the rail.--2) Ride into the feature on a toeside carve and with a slight bit of inclination on the takeoff. This will help get your center of mass over the rail.-- 3) As you ride up the jump, pop with both feet and land slightly on the side of the rail. You wanna hit the side of the rail and then roll ontop of the rail. This squance of moves will help rediret your momentum down the rail vs. across the rail. --4) Make sure you're locked on the rail before adding the backside 180. You have to lock in as fast as possible. --5) This next step gets a bit complicated de50so reread this as many times as you need. I peronally feel the faster I do the swivel the easier it is to balance and stay on the rail. As you're in the frontside 5050, drive your back shoulder behind you in the backside direction and then immediately rotate your hip. As you're rotating your hips take your back foot and swing it down the rail and your lead foot moves in oppositions. Rotate till you've completed a 180. --6) You'll notice in the video that my shoulders end up in a very countered posotion. This is very useful to stop the rotation at the 180 mark. As you ride off the end of the rail, allow your upper body to match back up with your lower body and continue riding switch!--Does this trick look simple or crazy complex?

Your support is unreal, and I so motivated to keep the content coming! Again, thank you!--Practicing a cartwheel outside of snowboarding is a great place to start. Below, I'm going to highlight a few critical points to nailing a cartwheel. --1) The first thing you gotta do is find the right feature to \"assist\" you in this trick. You're looking for something up, flat, and then down. This feature makes starting the trick easier by pushing your nose into something to get the trick started. The flat section makes cartwheels easier because you don't have to reach as far down. The down part gives you time to get your feet around. You can use a mogul as an alternative.--2) Ride into the feature with a bit of speed. This speed will help get your feet up and over your body. --3) Ride into the feature with your hands up and your center of mass towards the center of your board. As you're getting closer to the lip of the feature, shift your weight over your nose and bring your hands towards the ground. --4) Right before your hands touch the ground, your center of mass should be shifted past the nose. At this time, the tail of your board should rise off the ground. Reach your lead hand on the ground. --5) Now, the key to getting your legs to go over your body starts with how you place your backhand on the snow. I like to think about taking my backhand and reaching slightly over my head and putting it on the ground. The second hand should touch the ground after the first hand, not at the same time. As you do this, you'll feel your legs go over your head. --6) As both hands touch the ground, pull your legs up and over. It would be best if you kept your arms extended, so you're supporting your weight with your skeletal structure.--7) As your legs are coming back to earth, you want to pull your legs under neath your center of mass as fast as possible. If you're lazy with this step, you'll end up in the back seat. --8) Ride away!--#snowboarding #cartwheels #Snowboarder #snowboard @telosSnowboards #snow",

The principles for this switch backside 180 is applicable for both regular and goody riders. --First things first, find a feature that is within your comfort zone and dial in the speed. This step is essential, so you only have to focus on the trick, not everything else. --1) Do as many or as little speed checks as need, but make sure you're taking off the jump in a toeside carve. --2) As you're riding up the jump, remain on a slight toeside carve with your knees bent to create the pop. I like popping off both feet at the same time. This helps me stay in a balanced position while in the air. You don't want to take off leaning too far back or forward, so taking off both feet helps prevents that.--3) As the nose of my board is leaving the lip, I'm taking my switch back shoulder and pretending that I'm elbowing someone hard behind me. This movement will help drive the rotation in the backside direction.--4) As I drive my shoulder and spot the landing with the eye as soon as possible. This allows my upper body to lead the rotation, and I specifically allow my lower body to lag behind just a bit. --5) As you're about 90 degrees, speed up the rotation of your lower body to point straight down the hill. The more comfortable you get with these movements, the more you can add style and delay the rotation. --6) Once your feet hit the ground, try driving your back knee over your back toe to help jam that edge into the snow. I use this technique in my riding a lot. Rewatch some of my other videos, and you'll notice I do that landing movement a bunch. --7) Ride Away like a boss!!! yewww--Thanks @telosSnowboards for making such a sick board.

Should I do more rails tricks, park tricks, or all mountain freestyle?--I suggest that you practice flat ground backside 180s and switch backside 180's before attempting this challenge. --1) Start this trick with a toeside carve while keeping your chest tall and knees bent. Also, take your lead shoulder and wind up about 40 degrees. --2) While your board is pointing relatively down the fall line begin to shift your weight over your lead foot. You will throw your shoulders to start the 180 while up extending your back leg to unweight the board. --3) Ss you're unweight the board, keep your nose of your board on the ground. An excellent way to think about keeping your weight over your nose is to stack your belly button just to the inside of your lead binding. Be careful of getting the tip of your board caught in the snow. Find that pivot point this just under the tip of the board. --4) As you're rotating over your nose, keep your core tight so you can have your upper body and lower body rotate together. This step is essential because you want to land in the ready position to do the next 180, but if you're twisted, it's hard to do them immediately right after each other.--5) Retract your back knee until your board has just about completed the backside 180. Once your board is pointed down the fall line, push your knees over your toes to engage a toeside carve. This quick movement will help prevent additional rotation. --6) Now repeat the steps switch! --Have you subscribed to my YT channel yet? I've got some sick and detailed breakdowns over there.

I have a how to wax video and a 20% discount code for @purlwax (first purchase only). DM for the links.---Thanks the_ski_doctor for the clips.-Let's discuss why this is called a frontside boardslide. This is frontside because you're entering the feature with the front of your body facing the rail while landing on your lead foot. I hope that helps. --1) The sickest thing about gapping to a front board is that it gives you time to get in the right body positions, and it looks cool too. Haha.  Find a feature that is within your comfort zone and make sure you have front boards on lock. --2) I suggest gapping to a 5050 before attempting the front board. --3) Enter the feature with a decent amount of speed. As you're riding up, the jump begins to pop while keeping your board, lead hip, and lead shoulder pointed at the spot you want to land. You want to take about a 15-degree angle into the rail, but this will change depending on how big the gap is. --4) As you're in the air, keep your lead shoulder pointed at the end of the rail and rotate your hips uphill 90 degrees. I like retracting my knees at this time to help stay balanced and in control. --5) As you're about to land on the rail at 90 degrees, you want to extend your knees then absorb the impact of the landing. You can keep your knees up longer if you need to gain a few extra feet of distance. You def wanna make it to the down and not land on the kink. --6) Hold this position for the duration of the rail. Continue to keep your eyes and lead shoulder pointed at the end of the rail. Keeping your shoulders pointed at the end of the rail will help you come out your normal direction. --7) As you come off the rail, realign your lower body and land like a boss!--8) You want to land in a controlled position in case you need to stop fast and accidentally spray @johnathanbuckhouse in the face.

Most of the principles will apply to both. --1) First, get low and pop off of the jump/hip. You want to pop off the jump/hip to control on how you leave the jump vs. being passive. --2) Once you're in the air, keep your lead knee flexed while extending your back leg. At the same time, rotate your board and hips 90 degrees in the backside direction and grab the nose of your board with your backhand. --Focus on getting this grab before added the tweak. I suggest getting this grab 15-25 times before attempting the next steps. Trust me; this will help in the long run!--3) Once you have a good grip on the grab, take that same hand and drive it across your body. The initiation of this trick comes from your hand, not the lower body. --4) As you're about to max out the length of your shoulder, take your back leg and give it a little extra kick in the frontside direction. --5) Hold this as long as you can to get a sick photo or video. As your getting closer to the ground, let go of the grab and land.

Link in bio, my doods!--If you're doing Backside, 360's off a catwalk or natural terrain, I suggest knowing what's underneath before sending it. I scoped this spot out and hit it a few times to build my confidence and awarness.--1) The key here is to dial in the speed, the pop, and how hard you throw the trick. The faster you go, the more you pop....the less intense you need to throw the trick. --2) Perform a toeside carve while bending your knees and opening your lead shoulder about 45-90 degrees as you're approaching the lip of the jump or catwalk. --3) You want to time the throw and pop, so you're maximizing your trajectory. I think about leaving off the last 3rd of my toeside edge. I recommend that you are practicing this technique off smaller jumps/ side hits. --4) As I drive off the lip, I try to get my head to rotate in the backside direction and spot the landing as soon as possible. My spotting my landing, I'm able to adjust my body positions in the air. I immediately knew I was going deep, so I knew I needed to be in a stacked position at the landing. This stacked position will help me absorb the impact without getting hurt. --5) As soon as I threw this backside 3, I felt like I threw the three too hard. You'll notice in the video that my lead shoulder is slightly counter rotated throughout the spin. This was my attempt to slow the rotation down, so I didn't overcook the rotation. --6) At every step of the way, you need to be processing information and making adjustments. Not every trick, throw or pop is perfect. Keep your eyes up, and body balanced as a start then adjust as needed. --Land in a stacked position with your board and lead shoulder all pointed in the same direction.

Link in bio to subscribe. --I recommend learning how to grab your snowboard as soon as possible because it's useful when spinning, being in control, and adding style. Make sure your comfortable hitting side hits, jumps, or catching air with your knees retracted. I suggest getting used to retracting your knees on the majority of your airs. It will make learning grabs way easier. --1) Find a jump that is within your comfort zone and dial in the pop/speed.--2) As your riding into the jump, sink down by flexing your knees. Keep your lead shoulder, lead hip, and board all pointed in the same direction. If you're taking off the jump with your lead shoulder rotated open 45 degrees, this can cause you to rotate in the air and crash. Not sick, right?--3) Extend your knees to create pop. By popping, it will give you more time to get the grabb....but more importantly, when you pop, you take control of the specific outcome vs. the jump dictating what's going to happen. You don't want to be a passenger; you want to be the driver in this situation. --4) Once you're in the air, place your hand between your knees and bring the board up as high as possible. It's important to avoid leaning over with your chest and grabbing your board. By breaking at the waist and dripping your chest, you can lean your center of mass too far forward and land on your face. Trust me; it's not sick. Keep your spine relatively upright. --5) Grab between your bindings to make this grab \"proper\". Avoid grabbing outside the binding on your toe side edge. That's not proper. --Bonus: To add the tweak, grab outside your knees then between the bindings. Extend your lead foot towards the ground --6) Let go of the grab and extend your feet to meet the ground.

I'm going live tonight at 7mst, If you got any snowboard questions, hit me up there. Link in the bio, my doods!--First, you have to find a hip or a side hit that's within your ability level. Start small, and of course, you're going to wanna scope it out and know exactly what you're getting into. I'm going to breakdown what I did on this hip. let's get started--1) After you find the side hit or hip, you want to dial in the speed. The more speed, generally, the bigger you will go. --2) As you're riding into the feature, think about starting low. If you're starting low, your natural movement is to pop. If you start tall, you're going have a higher chance of absorbing the lip, not popping it. --3) Before heading into the feature, flex both of your knees and keep your spine upright. This position will give you power and balance. As you're riding up the face of the hip, progressively extend your knees to create the pop. If you want to maximize pop, delay your pop and pop more rapidly. Time your pop, so your tail is leaving last out of the lip. --4) When hitting hips with a natural trajectory from the left to the ride and that naturally put slightly on a heelside edge. In this video, I'm going straight over the hip; therefore, I'll be taking off a more flat base.--5) Once you're in the air, retract your knee and keep your eyes on the landing.  As a byproduct of retracting your knees, you are creating more separate from the ground, thus making the air look bigger. (YEWWW) --6) If you want to spice it up a bit, rotate your hips either frontside or backside. It's great to get comfortable with both. In this video, I was thinking about shifting my hips and legs like a frontside boardslide without the rail. This helps tricks my body into the position. Also, this is a great way to train your body for huge front board gaps.--7) Keep your shoulder pointed towards the landing and then bring your lower body back under you and ride --#snowboarding #snowboarders # Snowboard #copper #woodward #woodwardcopper #letsdothis @telossnowboards #snow",

Thanks, @_cameaton_, for filming!--Before getting frontside 180's on lock, you're going to need to work on your switch riding. I have a \"How To Turn\" and \"How To Ride Switch\" videos on my youtube channel. Link In Bio. --1) Find a mellow pitch to try some frontside 180's. If your switch riding isn't strong, stick to a mellow run, so you don't pick up too much speed.--2) Do a toeside turn, and then as you begin your heelside turn, begin winding up your shoulders. While you're winding up your shoulders, bend your knees and prepare to pop. --3) I love to pop the crap out of my frontside 180's. I'm going to explain how I do this. As I begin to throw the frontside 180, I shift my weight back towards the tail of the board. I also retract the lead knee to build up as much pressure as possible. Once the pressure has built, release the pressure by retracting the back knee. This sequence of moves will have your board sping in the air. --4) While you're building the pressure from the previous step, throw your shoulders in the frontside direction. Rewatch the video and notice that I emphasized driving the back shoulder to 180 degrees. When you drive your back shoulder, the rest of your body wants to follow. --5) Once you're in the air, retract your knees and engage your core. Also, keep your spine relatively verticle to maintain balance. --6) Around the 130 degrees mark, you may need to accelerate your lower body to get the board pointed down the fall line. You can also counter rotate your new lead shoulder to help slow down the rotation.--7) I love to land in a toeside carve.
